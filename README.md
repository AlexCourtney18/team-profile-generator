# Team Profile Generator

## Description
The application takes the user's inputs to create a functional employee directory. The user can input information for the manager, the engineers, and the interns.
The prompts will direct the user to input information accordingly and ask the user which type of employee they'd like to add. When the user is finished entering employee information,
they can select "N" when prompted to add another employee, or the "finish" choice on the add employee screen. When finished, the application generates a new HTML folder with working
links to quickly send an email to the employee or view the engineer's GitHub profile.

## Installation
For the application to function, the user will need to download the code form the GitHub repository. The user will also need to have node.js installed along with npm, inquirer, and jest.

## Usage
With the dependencies installed, the user will open the code in VSC and run the command "node index.js" in the command terminal. This will prompt the user with a series of questions to populate the HTML file. THe user can also run the command "npm run test" to verify the four written tests are passing correctly.
